### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
```

I couldn't get the library to work so I removed that code so it would knit.

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
states <- read_csv("data/states.csv")
dn <- read_csv("data/dennys.csv")
lq <- read_csv("data/laquinta.csv")
```

### Exercise 1

1. Filter the Denny’s dataframe for Alaska (AK) and save the result as dn_ak. How many Denny’s locations are there in Alaska?

```{r the many Dennys of AK}
dn_ak <- dn %>%
  filter(state == "AK")
nrow(dn_ak)
```
